    <div class="subtitle">The Art of Programming — Margit Rosen</div>

    <div class="text">
        "The concept of 'art as research' seemed to allow for dispensing with abstract discussions as to whether or not
        works from the laboratory were art, and what distinguished artist from scientists — the kind of debate that
        tends to reinforce identities and boundaries rather than assist in transforming them."

    <div class="text">
        "As practices and objectives [of the New Tendencies] that had prepared the arrival of the computer, [Radislav]
        Putar cited the 'anonymity and the exclusion of subjectivity', 'extinction of the meaning of the singular and
        the irreproducible creative act of an individual genius,' 'team work', giving 'work the habits of a machine,'
        the basing of 'procedures on the use of mechanical or electrical devices,' and 'programming'."
    </div>

    <div class="text">"[Karl] Gerstner's oeuvre actually contained the two entangled meanings that the concept of
        'programming' had for the New Tendencies in the early years: first, as a description of variable works the
        elements of which can be rearranged; secondly, as a methodical design process. [...] In 1963 Gerstner published
        the book <i>Programme entwerfen</i> [Designing Programs] that bore the promising motto <i>Statt Lösungen für
            Aufgaben
            Programme für Lösungen</i> [Instead of Solutions for Problems Programs for Solutions]."</div>

    <div class="text">"In 'Pour une peinture expérimentale programmée,' Morellet insisted that pictorial experiment
        should be 'based on controllable elements, whereby systematic progress would be made by following a program. The
        development of an experiment should run on its own, almost outside the control of the programmer.' [...]
        Traceability, according to Morellet, should contribute to desmystifying the artistic act. Mavigner, by contrast,
        emphasized that the programmed permutation, which he mechanically elaborated precisely after having set the
        program, led to results about which he would have otherwise remained ignorant. The procedure liberated him from
        the artistic cliché of the intuition and facilitated control 'even from such chaotic influences such as taste,
        tradition, fashion, the art trade, prestige, etc.'"</div>

        "The computer seemed to bring to an end the artist's quest to separate the creator and the

        "... the dream of the artist seemed to have found their technical <i>Wieldergänger</i> not only in the
        discipliing,
        anonymizing processes between Teletype, card reader, computers, and plotters. 'Chance', a phenomenon that had
        fascinated artists throughout the centuries, now conquered the gallery spaces in the form of 'pseudorandom
        numbers'."

    <div class="text">
        "If we were to paraphrase Samuel Beckett's rethorical question 'What matter who's speaking?' then the question
        'Does it matter who's calculating?' which resulted from the substitution of the artist by the computer, must be
        answered in the affirmative. It made a difference if the artist or the computer calculated. Actors, operations,
        and orientations changed, and unanticipated effects eventuated. One outcome was that the 'visual' was put into
        question. Even though there were examples in the New Tendencies for notations of programs, both as sketches and
        formulas, the value of artifacts produced on this basis was never oppugned. Yet, the status of the physical
        artwork was radically queried by the new protagonists of the New Tendencies who were not trained in art studios
        and history courses, but by hands-on experience with calculating machines: '[Leslie] Mezei and also Peter
        Milojevic could not understand,' wrote Frieder Nake in March 1969 to curator Boris Kelemen, 'why the competition
        of t-4 is for "objects" and nor for "programs", and why nevertheless flow diagrams are requested."

        "[Umberto] Eco, who wrote the introductory text to the <i>arte programmata</i> catalog, described the mobile
        objects
        as epistemological metaphors with which the artists reacted to the scientific taming of chance by way of
        probability theory and statistics. He characterized them as 'events fields.' They rendered perceptible the new
        'unique dialectic between chance and program, between mathematics and hazard.'"

        "In terms of visual research [...], not only had the viewer [the public] been discovered as an acting subject,
        but also as an object of examination [...]. Giovanni Anceschi and Davide Boriani sought to detect systematically
        the aesthetic preferences of the visitor on the basis of information aesthetics, GRAV would repudiate this by
        using the onlooker 'as a statistical factor by subjecting him to tests.'"

        "... he [Herbert W. Franke] outlined the possibilities of interactive, cybernetic performances — in the
        constructive spirit of the New Tendencies: 'In contrast to the happening which mainly involves destructive
        elements, highly complex structures of order are also accessible through the logical capacity of the computer.'
        Reaction to Franke's proposal are not documented, neither to the suggestions by Branimir Makanec and A. Michel
        Noll. Makanec and Noll revealed an aspect of 'programming,' that had accompanied programmed art prior to 1968 as
        a shadow: the programming of the beholder. In his <i>bit international</i>article the scientist, who contributed
        to
        the production of Stanley Kubrick's <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> (1968) as scientific advisor, went one step
        further.
        He pointed to the possibilities of cybernetic systems, which are not just systems that can be observed, but that
        themselves observe: 'The computer could monitor the participant's emotional state and change it according to the
        artist's specifications.'"

        "... the scientists and engineers of Bell Telephone Laboratories had sent to Zagreb a selection of
        computer-processed photographs, sophisticated experiments with symbols and Gestalt effects. The applied
        techniques had been developed as part of research carried out on electronic image analysis and transmission. In
        this context, in engineering, the objective was maximum reduction of the quantity of data with maximum retention
        of quality for the human eye. Here, bit — the unit with which images were measured — was not a
        technical-aesthetic, but a technical-economic category. Once a picture was worth a thousand words; now, one
        picture was worth <i>n</i> bits: this meant<i>n</i> minutes on a telephone line or <i>n</i> minutes of computing
        time. Time
        had to be paid. The jury of the 1969 competition 'Computers and Visual Research,' comprising Umberto Eco, Karl
        Gerstner, Martin Krampen, and Vera Horvat-Pintaric, presented Bell Telephone Laboratories with an award "for the

        uncritical embrace of computer technology. In the service of automation, it was merely an additional means of
        capitalist exploitation of the working classes. In the contribution he submitted to the 1969 symposium, the
        London-based artist Gustav Metzger formulated a critique of the computer that went far beyond its function in
        the class struggle: computer technology had made a decisive contribution to the development of the hydrogen
        bomb, and it was the central instrument of development and control in contemporary warfare."

        "The issue that lies at the core of the debate about media art and digital art may be summarized thus: Is media
        art (or digital art, or any machine-assisted form of art) an alien, which has violently invaded or has been
        forced upon the art world from outside, and therefore something entirely foreign to art? Or are the media arts a
        part of art evolution, which have evolved from inside of art and the aesthetic intentions of the artists? Is
        media art an integral part of art or not, is it a continuum of art or a rupture, an expansion or an intrusion?

        "Here, in the context of Concrete, Constructivist, and Kinetic art, the term 'program' was not understood in the
        sense of 'programming a computer'. Even when an artist used the term intuitively, the notion 'programming' was
        already there. Artists spoke of systematic experiments in their search for a structure or gestalt of
        controllable elements, which behave according to a predictable program. This also included the idea of the
        variable, which introduced surprise into the deterministic idea of the program. The elements of a picture or a
        sculpture were seen as parts of a whole, of a system, whose order is either subject to a predefined program or
        to chance. Programmed art, that thereby realized both moments of control and freedom, namely randomness, made
        the participation of the viewer possible, who would at the same moment fulfil the plan of the artist and serve
        as an element of chance."

        Julio Le Parc: "From the conceptual point of view, the notion of programming (often used in the New Tendencies)

        the conditions of the work's process, clearly determining its modalities so that it can be free to produce
        itself in space and time, subject to the foreseen circumstances of both determinant and indeterminate quality,
        which come from the environment in which it produces itself and from the activated or active participation of

        "In his [Bonacic's] article 'Kinetic Art: Application of Abstract Algebra to Objects with Computer-controlled
        Flashing Lights and Sound Combinations' (1974) he noted: 'One of the most interesting aspects of this work [on
        Galois fields, titled 'PLN' by Bonacic] is the demonstration of the different visual appearance of the patterns
        resulting from the polynomials that had not been noted before by mathematicians who have studied Galois fields."

        "The Dynamic Objects [produced and assembled from electronic components by Bonacic himself] were embodied
        statements of what he later elaborated on in his critique of the influence of commercially available display
        equipment on the computer-based arts. In his 1974 article 'Kinetic Art', Bonacic emphasized that this was 'akin
        to an artist being limited to the use of only two or three colours in a painting...'"
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        Bonacic: "To integrate computer systems and art [as in Dynamic Objects], without allowing one to dominate the
        other, is seen as a step toward the common language. This means that the artist and their work of art are able
        to communicate; artists and their art use a common language."

    <div class="text">
        "The Dynamic Object GF. E 32-S (1969/1970) generates consecutive Galois field elements at maximal distance from
        each other, and displays them as symmetrical patterns by synchronous selective flashing on the front panel of
        the object. The object resembles a screen made of a 32 x 32 grid of squared aluminum tubes containing light
        bulbs. The total 'screen resolution' is 1,024 monochrome 'pixels'. The Galois field generator is part of a
        special-purpose computer located inside the object. The unit is self-contained. <br> <br>
        The clock that controls the rhythm of the appearance of the visual pattern is variable. The rhythm can be
        adjusted between 0.1 seconds and 5 seconds by the observer. At a frequency range of 2 seconds, the same pattern
        will be repeated in approximately 274 year's time."

        Bonacic: "I am specially sceptical of the attempts to produce computer art through play with randomness and the
        deliberate introduction of errors in programs prepared for non-artistic purposes. <br> <br> [...] <br> <br>
        The random generator creates the accidental and unique presentation, which has neither value nor importance for
        human beings. Such information can evoke various associations in the observer. However, a computer used in such
        a way lags far behind the human being. Even if the expressive potentialities of the computer were equal to those
        of a human being, the essence of Pollock's world and creation would not be surpassed, regardless of the
        complexity of future computers or peripheral units. That, of course, does not mean that a man (or a monkey or
        other animal) aided by a computer could not create an aesthetically relevant object if they act consciously or
        unconsciously obeying the law of accident."

        "Contrary to Bonacic's wishes of 1968 — that computer art should not mimic human-made images —
        computer-generated art pursued a different path. Computer graphics explored the possibilities of
        computer-generated figurative visuals and entered — through providing animation and special effects for the
        mainstream film industry — the commercial world, as well as the military complex, advancing virtual reality
        techniques that mimic 'real life'. Within the context of the dominance of emerging practices of conceptual and
        non-object art that utilized post-Duchamp ideas of art and representation, this development led to
        computer-generated art's almost total exclusion from the contemporary art scene by the mid-1970s. This was
        propelled by a rising anti-computer sentiment among the majority of the new generation of artists in view of the

        War and elsewhere."

        all the present-day movements have had to call on extra-visual, anecdotal justifications. <br> <br>
        (This masterpiece was painted by the artist clad in a medieval knight's costume in 16'28"; or altenatively a
        naked woman has rolled over this painting, or, again, this bolt struck on to this relief used to belong to the
        valet of a well-known picture dealer, with whom the artist no longet has any dealings.) This extra-visual
        summons recurs in another way: by calling on the onlooker's imagination, so that he/she will experience an
        intellectual pleasure, knowing that this hermetically sealed box contains an endless line or a dollop of the
        author's shit (whatever else, don't open it). We always find the same extra-visual summons, this time among
        Concrete artists, for example: for such and such a picture, in which six lines are placed in an irregular way,
        the extremely rational game consists in knowing that, despite the apparent dissimilarity between the six lines,
        all six are of the same length. Without mentioning all those who, with geometric or irregular lines, attempt to
        create some kind of anecdotal connection, expressed in the form of titles, such as: "the whole soul summed

        "The fatalistic race of forced and one-sided technological development has drawn all the forces at our disposal
        into its vortex, alienating them to the maximum in the aimlessness of the moment from which it is impossible to
        survey either yesterday or tomorrow. At that point, innate human nature screamed in a primal and most painful
        way, frantically seeking an echo in the wastes and hollow lap of matter. On this threshold of utmost opposition,
        at least a partial turnabout was bound to happen. Actually, it had happened long ago in most progressive
        spiritual insights, but in the social sphere its repercussions are slower and more painful. However, they have
        brought about the almost complete destruction of all sacralized values of civil society, although they have not
        destroyed the principal and last idol — the notion of commodity. The commodity has turned even the fear of world
        destruction and a bottomless abyss into money, completely blunting the confused edge of undesigned rebels.
        Nevertheless, impulses of definitive dissolution of form as the last remnant of the classical way of thinking
        through fixed shapes became clearly visible in their expression. Notions about the functioning of sensory and
        emotional mechanisms were interwoven with notions of indeterminism and not only with the notion of relativity as
        well as the law of probability. The manifestation of a higher variety of thinking through complex structures was
        enabled. This entirely surpasses the narrow problematics of the human emotional sphere and the interests of the
        individual psyche. The question of the other individual naturally arises; not only from the romantic nostalgia
        for human properties, but also from the necessity of the insight that a single individual is nothing and that
        only everyone is everything. A possibility of historical projection, a possibility of an ideology of

        'machines that make us think' is valuable for philosophy. It entails the concept of philosophical machines, the

        understood that there is a limit to this operation and that at a certain point it will be necessary to change
        doctrines. Here, the question of the construction of a work of art by the machine becomes interesting. In fact
        it claims to approach the work of art in every possible way and to propose simulacres each time; each
        characteristic is based on operationality and the 'degree' is not misused to qualify this method as a

        "<i>1st attitude</i> [toward the nature of creation]: The world is full of wealth that must be exploited.
        Following
        the criteria of originality, this results in the transformation of every system of exploration of this world
        into a system of valorization of works of art: this would be the spectator machine or the artificial auditor. It
        includes at the input a translator which transform sensations into the language of the machine (for example,
        television camera, artificial ear, digital-analog transducer). The machine digests the messages thus contained
        by passing them through a 'filter' program that is one of the 'mechanical' values that gauges, for example, the
        rate of redundancy, the number of repetitions, and the number of elements of symmetry (George David Birkhoff).
        From an informational point of view, it analyzes the architecture of external spectacles, the hierarchy of their
        order. It attributes a global value resulting from the composition of partial values at the different levels,
        according to the rules dictated by the aesthetician who developed the program, and according to his knowledge of
        the psychology of sensation. The machine chooses the spectacles that exceed a certain rate of value, qualifies
        them as 'works of art', stores them in its memory, and is then able to regurgitate them on demand by
        retranslating them at the output into sensory phenomena, this time with the help of a <i>digital-analog
            transducer</i>, a television receiver or a generator of complex sounds. <br> <br>
        The role of the machine is to help the aesthetician to serve mechanical critique. If the world is full of
        beautiful things, the critic will be transformed into an artist, as soon as he places a frame around a small
        piece of asphalt, which his infallible gaze will have appreciated as being aesthetic. One notes that no one is
        'responsible' in this process. The program is provided by the <i>consensus omnium</i> of humanity and the source

        can be extremely large; the human being could trace a particular trajectory in it and innocently pass to the

        field of possibilities and of filtering whatever the value of each of the millions of created works to save the

        the human observer is incapable of mastering the flood of originality that assails him, and that his most simple
        reaction is to deny it. However, 'seeing machines' (<i>machines à voir</i>), using analog-digital converters
        transforming the visual forms into packets of cards, followed by a calculating operation, can, on the contrary,
        systematically analyze the auto-correlations eventually existing on a larger scale between the disparate
        elements of the images. They evoke a kind of phosphorescence of objectifiable impressions which sometimes
        generate super-signs or forms exclusively resulting from an intersection in a field of consciousness (ferrite

        capitalist economic world. Thus, any innovation is used by a well-defined class to continue its exploitation of
        the working class. Everyone has seen that the consequence of increased mechanization is increased exploitation
        of man by man. Increased automation has not diminished man's exertions or given him greater freedom at work. On
        the contrary, it is used to rationalize exploitation. Artists cannot remain indifferent to those conditions.

    <div class="text">
        "This orientation of consciousness [that began in the Enlightment and entered the realm of art in approximately
        1920] essentially deals with the awareness that the world is artificial, reality is a convention, and people's
        awareness of their surroundings is determined by their environment, primarily by language. If reality does not
        exist naturally as an absolute, then this means that it is artificial; that is, produced. Under these
        conditions, those who are directly involved in the production of reality are assigned a great deal of
        importance. <br> <br>
        The literature of recent decades has dealt constantly, in great depth, with 'reality-generating' factors
        (usually in the form of scathing critiques). <br> <br>
        I believe we will only be able to speak of generated reality, that is, of the effect of reality, when changes
        occur in the consciousness of the consumer; changes that represent reality as long as the process is underway:
        reality is a process that becomes unreal at the moment it comes to a standstill — reality exists only in change.
        <br> <br>
        Thus, it is a matter of the production of realities, whereby only those come into consideration as producers
        whose products have not yet been consumed, are new, and therefore actually 'real' because they are effective.
        Those who remodel things that have already entered into general consciousness, who make already existing things
        'better' (as though one could make reality more real), in other words, the most varied types of gala artists,
        commercial decorators, and star designers, cannot be considered among these producers due to the fact that the
        pseudo-consumption of these psychological managers' products does not actually present or resolve any genuine
        problems since here we are no longer dealing with true consumption: that which has already been consumed has
        already lost its effectiveness, and therefore is also no longer real. <br> <br>
        Yet, since the reality of an artistic realization (<i>Realisat</i>), that is, one that first enters the
        consumption
        process, cannot be called into question, then this is actually the creation of methods to generate realities."

        "We speak of modern aesthetics insofar as it employs mathematical and empirical procedures, uses abstract ideas
        and models, and pursues besides numerical-descriptive also technological goals. Thus, such aesthetics can also
        be called abstract or mathematical aesthetics. Unlike classical aesthetics, for instance Hegelian aesthetics,
        modern aesthetics does not rest on a philosophical but on a methodological concept; that is, it is oriented on
        <i>objective</i> rather than subjective problems."
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        "The description of the 'aesthetic state' of an artistic object occurs in four phases, so that we accordingly
        distinguish between <i>Numerical aesthetics</i>, <i>Semiotic aesthetics</i>, <i>Semantic aesthetics</i>, and
        <i>Generative
            aesthetics</i>. <br> <br>
        <i>Numerical aesthetics</i> is material aesthetics; it primarily describes the 'material' givens of an artistic
        object. It is further 'selective' aesthetics because its specifications grasp the artistic process as a process
        of selection, for which an artistic object is merely a 'structured set of elements'. Its goal is, therefore, to
        attain numerical values such as frequencies, entropies, statistical data, and redundancies which, instantiated
        in the general aesthetics measuring function developed by George David Birkhoff, lead to singular values for a
        '<i>material aesthetic state</i>'. <br> <br>
        [...] <i>Semiotic aesthetics</i> is 'relational aesthetics of signs insofar as it understands its fundamental
        concept
        of the 'sign' (following Charles Sanders Peirce) as a 'triadic relation' and grasps the artistic process as a
        process of signs. [...] Accordingly, the goal of Semiotic aesthetics is specifying the classes of signs that are
        relevant to the construction of an artistic object, that is, the semiotic classification of an artwork. [...]
        Semantic aesthetics presupposes the semiotic analysis of an artistic object. <br> <br>
        <i>Semantic aesthetics</i> describes the 'aesthetic state' as a 'meaning carrier'. [...] Semantic aesthetics is
        decidedly related to 'aesthetic communication', that is, to its <i>process of encoding and decoding</i>. <br>
        <br>
        The most recent development in modern aesthetics is called <i>Generative aesthetics</i>. Its goal is the
        analysis of
        art-generating processes into a <i>finite number of constructive steps</i>. Thus, Generative aesthetics concerns
        'definite' aesthetics. In the ideal case, it leads to the deployment of 'programs' that serve to produce
        'aesthetic states' with the help of <i>program-controlled computers</i>."

        "The successive decomposition of equiprobable distributions into distributions that are non-equiprobable or are

        the mechanical art-generating process."
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        "... <i>descriptions of Numerical aesthetics</i> bring to light empirically 'measured data' that represent
        'singular
        orders,' whereas <i>Semiotic aesthetics</i> designates 'meanings' that are general orders as interpreted by its
        classifications. 'Singular order' yields <i>innovation</i>, and hence that which is the real core of
        'statistical
        information' and which art theory commonly calls 'originality', whereas 'general order' enables
        <i>identifications</i>, and hence that with which communication is actually concerned, is called 'statistical
        redundancy' and corresponds roughly to 'style' in art theory. Consequently, we speak of 'innovative' and
        'redundant states of order', or of 'creative' and 'communicative order.' <br> <br>

        as 'sinisigns'."

        "My experimental method of computer-aided visual art (pictures) differs in its character from the observation of
        empirical facts and the inductive abstraction of a general law of art. To actually produce a picture, the
        computer needs to contain the program that formulates the artist method <i>a priori</i>. During and after this
        experiment, we may not recognize the law of aesthetic experience, but already <i>before</i> the experiment, we
        must
        <i>pre-cognize</i> a certain artistic law without having any accomplished aesthetic experience. The
        art-generative
        program is just his pre-cognized artistic law: that is, the algorithm of artistic creation. This law seems to be
        logical rather than empirical because it is pre-cognized a priori. The program of the computer is, therefore, a
        sort of axiom, a geometrical or logical transformation rule. This axiomatic program consists of two parts: 1)
        the elements, such as aesthetic quanta or alphabet letters, etc., which are taken as axiomas carrying the
        aesthetic universe of a picture, and 2) the probablilistic law of the syntatic connections between <i>n</i>-gram
        elements, which is taken as the transformation rule. From this a priori axiomatic system, certain artificial
        pictures as theorems are generated deductively. Through these experiments, we can study different axiomatic
        systems and the patterns of various theorems deduced from them. [...] <br> <br>
        By repeating this experimental process, the system of this program becomes more and more refined and complete,
        and the generated works of art gradually become similar to pictures created by humans. From the perspective of
        this experimental simulation, the program as axiom has initially a hypothetical character, but its systematic
        character as a general law is strengthened after some revisions by experimental verification. An experimental
        process like this may be just a deductive one. Therefore, a computer-aided experiment of art has a logical
        character that differs from usual experiments in the empirical sciences whose methods depend upon observation
        and induction."

        "Heuristic programming, which is the method a human being would use in solving a problem, is applied to the
        computer. We start from the hypothesis and possible solutions that have to be checked, before we processd with
        trial and error. The solution is in fact the confirmation of the hypothesis, but heuristic programming does not
        promise it a priori. This method of identifying patterns also plays an important part in the solution of a
        problem. New and quite unpredictable structures obtained through computers reveal the essence of the process.
        One discovers unknown logic and laws, and results unobtainable through classical mathematical analysis appear.
        Transforming the structures within various coordinate systems and time, we find out the determination which
        gives us a more complete picture of the observed process."

        "In Ojibwa language, nouns fall into two classes distinguished by different plural suffixes. These classes refer
        to objects which correspond approximately to our Western 'animate' / 'inanimate' dichotomy. Stones, for example,
        belong to the class 'animate' nouns. [Irving] Hallowel once asked an old Ojibwa: 'Are <i>all</i> the stones we see
        about us here alive?' The old man reflected for a long while and answered: 'No! But <i>some</i> are.' <br> <br>
        There is evidence that personification of objects is not limited to a few primitive cultures, but that it may be
        universal. Everything which is mobile, capricious, unpredictable, responsive, origin of actions, locus of
        intrinsic power can assume a highly significant, threatening, or rewarding character in the psychological field,
        whether it be human, animal, or object. It is to this class of source phenomena that man tend to attach person
        characteristics. If somebody asked the question 'Are all machines we see about us persons?' a wise answer would

        that leads, in one direction from the actuality of form <br>
        to the structure of self-managed form and, in the other direction, <br>

        from ●●●●● to ● operative process <br> <br>
        here, form's actuality [...] <br>
        is seen as its own potential <br>
        to give at each given moment a historically congruent and homogeneous answer <br>
        to the questions set by the context of the ecological and eco-social system; <br>
        but in order for form to be actual, <br>
        it needs to be dynamic: <br>
        we proceed, therefore, from the attribute of form's actuality <br>
        to the attribute of form's dynamism. <br> <br>
        and dynamism of forms requires the latter to be <br>
        able to change at any given moment, <br>
        that is, to give a different formal answer. <br>
        so, since ecological and eco-social reality is in constant flux, <br>
        it is necessary to arrive at a dynamic form <br>
        capable of keeping up with such a reality. <br> <br>
        this implies the need for form to have a structure, <br>
        in other words, it is necessary to be able to identify a programmed structure <br>
        which enables all possible forms to exist <br>
        within the laws of a particular logical system: <br>
        that is, the alternating of all forms, each compatible with <br>
        and corresponding to a particular <br>
        historical moment and set of social requirements. <br> <br>
        at the end of this process <br>
        which at its origin assumes the concept of form as organism <br>
        and that of organism as form's structure, <br>
        form inevitably becomes amenable to self-management <br>
        and, therefore, it assumes the nature of self-managed form <br>
        both at personal and collective levels: <br>
        where the presence of structure as a 'system of transformations <br>
        and possibilities,' which can generate an infinite number of messages, <br>
        removes the contradiction between collective self-managed form <br>
        and personal self-managed form, <br>
        because the individual operation thus acquires <br>
        the philosophical and operative dimension of choral collaboration <br>
        in a process that transcends it; <br>
        a process which is, on the other hand, determined in its every aspect <br>

        experience gathered hitherto, the following mathematical disciplines may be considered useful for the product
        designer in his practical design activities: 1) theory of combinations (for modular systems and problems of
        dimensioanl coordination); 2) group theory (in the form of symmetry theory for the construction of grids and

        "Alphonse Chapanis writes: 'A couple of hundred of years ago it was the vogue to say that man is nothing more
        than a system of complicated levers and pneumatic tubes (the nerves and blood vessels) which carry energizing
        liquids. Fifteen or so years ago, it was popular to say that man is nothing but a servo. Now it is the thing to
        say that man is nothing but an information-handling channel. Call man a machine if you will, but do not
        underestimate him when you experiment on him. He is a non-linear machine; a machine that is programmed with a
        tape you cannot find; a machine that contiually changes its program without telling you; a machine that seems to
        be specially subject to the perturbations of random noise; a machine that thinks, has attitudes, and emotions; a
        machine that may try to deceive you in your attempts to find out what makes him function, an effort in which,
        unfortunately, he is sometimes succesful.' The trend towards simplification with which Chapanis deals here and
        against which he warns may be explained in part by the special nature of investigation to which ergonomists
        devoted themselves in latter years. They were primarily investigating control systems where man operated under
        extremely unfavorable circumstances to the limit of his sensorimotor capabilities, that is, in the critical zone
        'at which human performance deteriorated to an unaccepptable degree. These were investigations of exceptional
        machines — offensive weapons or defensive weapons — and of their not less exceptional operators, the soldiers.
        Because ergonomics has specialized to such a great extent in the solution of critical problems in military
        equipment, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between ergonomics and military psychology. 'Machines cannot
        fight alone' was the slogan of the modern ergonomist. The central subject of this discipline was, and still is
        today, to adapt weapons to the soldier, and, very often — despite all that ergonomists proclaim — to adapt the
        soldiers to the weapons."

        "I find it easy to admit that computer art did not contribute to the advancement of art, if we judge
        'advancement' by comparing the computer's products to all existing works of art. In other words, the repertoire
        of <i>results</i> of aesthetic behaviour has not been changed by the use of computers. (This point of view, namely
        that of art history, is shared and held against 'computer art' by many art critics.) <br> <br>
        There is no doubt in my mind, on the other hand, that interesting new <i>methods</i> have been discovered, which may
        be of some significance for the creative artist. And beyond methodology, but certainly influenced by it, we find
        that a thorough understanding of 'computer art' includes an entirely new relationship between the creator(s) and
        the creation: Max Bense uses the term 'art as a model for art' in this context."

        There is no need for the production of more works of art, particularly no need for 'computer art'. Art (better:
        the aesthetic object) comes afterwards (but it does come). Aesthetic information as such is interesting only for
        the rich and the ruling. For the others (and they are in the majority) it comes 'with'. Namely, with other
        information. <br> <br>
        Thus, the interest in computers and art should be to investigate aesthetic information as part of the

        We should not be interested in producing some more nice and beautiful objects by computers. We should be

        aesthetic information, is meaningful; the role of the computer in the production of aesthetic information per se
        and for the making of profit is dangerous and senseless."

    <div class="text">
        "... the disappearance of the visual in the field of art correlates to the controlling of non-perspective, that
        is, thought processes in science, so that more conceptual artists see art not only as an idea, but also as
        knowledge. By passing from purely visual aspects of the work to its cognitive aspects, and by attaching the same
        importance to them as that attached to scientific disciplines, Conceptual art has set out to fulfill the role of
        art history."
