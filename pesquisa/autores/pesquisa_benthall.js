        Proust, <i>A la recherche du temps perdu</i>: "Then I considered the spiritual bread that a newspaper is, still warm
        and moist from the recent press and from the morning fog, where it has been distributed since dawn to maids who
        bring it to their masters with the morning coffee — miraculous, multipliable bread, which is at the same time
        one and ten thousand, and which stays the same for everyone even though penetrating at once, innumerable, into
        every house."

        "Photography challenges our habitual notion of the control which artists are supposed, or were supposed, to have
        over their resources. It makes us query or redefine such terms as 'intention', 'subject-matter', 'content'; it
        makes us, first, respect the process of <i>selection</i> as potentially creative, and second, accept the intervention
        of random, or at least unpredicted, events as a legitimate part of the artist's output. For instance, there can
        be poignant juxtapositions of incident unnoticed at the time of exposure. In photography, there is no plastic
        substance like paint or bronze which the artist manipulates and over which he is supposed to maintain a sort of
        total control (though something of this control is available at the stage of printing and re-touching). The
        artist's hand is demoted from being a kind of organism in its own right, and becomes a mere trigger or
        stabilizer. Andrew Forge has written (1969) that 'photography is essentially an act of choice on instant; not
        the deployment of a language-like convention'; but I doubt if this is a good distinction. Many artists are
        preoccupied with aesthetic riddles of this kind, stimulated by such teasing predecessors as Duchamp, but also, I
        would guess, by the gradual impact of photography on aesthetics. Forge continues: 'The analogy for the
        photograph from within art did not exist when the camera was invented. Such an analogy was de the Duchampian
        Readymade.' <br> <br>
        There is surely no theoretical justification for regarding photography as a medium limited to art of minor
        quality. It is, crucially, a cumulative art, dependant on the building-up of sequences of related images — and
        this is part of my answer to Andrew Forge's remark quoted above. People often try to set up a particular
        photograph as a 'masterpiece' — like Stieglitz <i>The Steerage</i>. A single photograph may 'succeed' by accident.
        Almost all the great photographers are esteemed for having set themselves a particular path of controlled
        activity — for instance, Atget's studies of the trades and transactions of city life, or Hine's of the American
        poor."

        John Szarkowski, diretor de fotografia do Museu de Arte Moderna de Nova Iorque: "Like an organism, photography
        was born whole. It is in our progressive discovery of it that its history lies."

    <div class="text">
        "A full study of any medium must not confine itself to aesthetic aspects. 'High photography' must be related to
        the sociology of the medium as a hobby, ritual, folk art and industry. Improvements to the techniques are also
        important..."

        Proust, <i>A la recherche du temps perdu</i>: 'The searching, anxious, exacting way we have of looking at the person
        that we love, our waiting for the word which will give us or remove the hope of a rendezvous for the next day,
        and, until that word is spoken, our alternating, if not simultaneous, imaginings of joy and despair — all this
        makes our attention towards the beloved too tremulous to obtain from her a clean image. Perhaps also this
        activity of all the senses at once — which tries to ascertain, with looks alone, what is beyond them — is too
        indulgent to the thousand forms, to all the savours and movements of the living person who normally, when we are
        not in love, we immobilize. The cherished model, on the contrary, moves; one never has anything but failed
        photographs of her.... Not being able to see this well-loved face again, whatever effort I made to remember it,
        I was irritated to find, drawn in my memory with a definitive exactness, the useless and insistent faces of the
        merry-go-round man and the woman who sold barley-sugar.' <br> <br>
        "Proust's delicate metaphor, playing on the ideas of motion and emotion, takes the setting-up of a camera as an
        analogue not of human vision — Proust's knowledge of the psychology of perception was too great for that — but
        of human <i>attention</i>."

        "Photography teaches us to recognize a particular pop-singer or politician, or the analogous physiognomies of
        beauty-spots and touristic 'sights'; it helps the authorities monitor the behaviour and wherebaouts of criminals
        and aliens (as Andy Warhol's series <i>Most Wanted Men</i> observes). Photographs are also exchanged by lovers for
        reasons which Proust's hyphotesis helps to explain: and they alert separated members of a family to changes in
        each other's appearance, so that the eventual reunion after a lapse of time is less of a shock. <br> <br>
        John Sarkowski believes that there are two complementary ways of approaching photography, either as art — a
        controlled, coherent, measured personal statement — or as a 'great anonymous beast' that has modified our
        sensibility. The most interesting individual photographers, in his view, are those who have it both ways, whose
        photos are 'so uncompromisingly like photos that one could approach them as if they were not art at all'. A
        photo may of course be 'uncompromisingly like a photo' either because it could not have benn made by other
        technical methods, or because it recalls some widespread social application of the medium such as the snapshot
        or picture-postcard.

        "... the term 'computer' is seldom used in strict technical language. A digital computer is more exactly

        "If I were asked to define very briefly what the digital computer's most <i>distinctive</i> ability is, it is that it
        can keep its place. [...] What the computer can do better than the human brain is maintain accurately as many
        totals, sub-totals, cross-references, indexes and tabulations as we are care to tell it to. This applies to all
        information processing, whether of letters, numbers or other symbolic codes. <br> <br>
        The computer is thus a communication medium in much the same way as photography. If the camera extends our
        ability to recognize or <i>match</i> visual images such as faces, it may be speculated that the computer extends our
        ability to structure or organize information so that matching of symbols is made more efficient."

        "Nash and Williams conceive of the artist as someone who wants to make a 'personal statement' in the form of
        various squiggles, spheroids, etc. In fact, he could draw them for himself with a ruler and a pencil. Nash and
        Williams think it helpful to provide him [the artist] with a set of programming facilities ['packages'] so that
        he can make these squiggles, etc., at much greater expense and more laboriously. The justification claimed is
        that the artist does not have to find out about computers before using programme. There is, I think, a fallacy
        here: that of regarding the artist as a specialist with pre-defined professional needs. There must, according to
        this argument, be a special set of programming facilities for artists just as there is for architects."

        "There is a clear parallel between the experimental use of photography in the nineteenth century and
        experimental computer graphics. The use of camera lenses to make distortions and trick photographs seems to have
        been a favourite Victorian pastime, as Aaron Scharf has described. This was a frivolous parallel to the careful
        photographic experimentation by Muybridge and Marey."

        demonstrations; Cordeiro's work is a start towards bringing back human emotions into the cold and cerebral world
        of the computer."
